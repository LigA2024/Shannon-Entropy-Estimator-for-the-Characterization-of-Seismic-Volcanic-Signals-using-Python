# Shannon-Entropy-Estimator-for-the-Characterization-of-Seismic-Volcanic-Signals-using-Python
The "Shannon Entropy Estimator for the Characterization of Seismic-Volcanic Signals using Python." is a user-friendly interface that  enables easy and efficient management for working with the most commonly used seismic signal formats in observatories.
The system is composed of three independent modules:

a) Performs signal reading and filtering actions, using one or three components, and provides graphical representations of both the original and filtered signals.
b) Calculates and graphically represents metrics such as: Shannon Entropy (original and normalized), the envelope of the Shannon Entropy and its smoothed version using a cosine function with a Hann window, Kurtosis, Frequency Index, and Energy, along with their respective envelopes.
c) Presents a comparison of the Entropy envelope through the calculation of five types of frequency intervals within a filter previously selected by the user.

This entire procedure constitutes a great practical help for some observatories that need to have tools, programs, and specific software to carry out 
the reading of various formats, perform calculations, and present results. However, they encounter problems due to complicated tools (learning, handling, management, and change). 
In addition, data acquisition is carried out through external sites that the operators do not manage or control, or the data is provided by other 
observatories whose operating formats differ from those that will be processed and analyzed in the receiving observatory.

For these main reasons, it is important and extremely useful for the human operator to have a user-friendly system that performs 
the calculation process of large volumes of data using mathematical parameters such as Shannon Entropy, Kurtosis, Frequency Index, and Energy 
(complemented by their respective envelopes), obtaining results in a more reliable and simple way. In this way, much more information 
can be provided about the volcanic processes (pre-eruptive and post-eruptive), contributing to better early warning systems.
